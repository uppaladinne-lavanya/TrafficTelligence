Requirements Analysis – TrafficTelligence

🎯 Objective:

To clearly identify and document functional and non-functional requirements needed for building a robust, intelligent traffic monitoring and prediction system.


---

🔍 1. Functional Requirements

These define what the system should do.

🟢 Data Collection

Collect real-time traffic data from:

Live traffic APIs (e.g., Google Maps, TomTom)

CCTV camera feeds

IoT-based road sensors (if applicable)



🟢 Data Preprocessing

Clean and format raw traffic data

Handle missing or noisy data

Convert time-series inputs for ML model training


🟢 Machine Learning Model

Train model (CNN, LSTM, etc.) to:

Estimate current traffic volume

Predict future congestion levels


Output should include:

Traffic count per location

Congestion probability level



🟢 Dashboard Interface

User-facing dashboard to:

Display current and historical traffic data

Visualize congestion heatmaps or charts

Filter by region and time



🟢 Admin Panel

Upload new datasets

Monitor model performance

Access logs and usage stats


🟢 API Services

Provide RESTful APIs for:

Sending raw data

Fetching predictions

Accessing dashboard metrics

⚙ 2. Non-Functional Requirements

These define how the system should behave.

🔵 Performance

Real-time prediction latency < 2 seconds

Dashboard refresh every 10 seconds

Handle ≥ 100 concurrent users


🔵 Scalability

Should support deployment in multiple city zones

Must be horizontally scalable via containers


🔵 Security

Role-based access (Admin vs Viewer)

JWT-based API authentication

HTTPS communication


🔵 Reliability & Availability

99% uptime during operational hours

Automatic restart on failure (using Docker or PM2)


🔵 Maintainability

Modular architecture (e.g., Microservices)

Clean logging and error-handling mechanisms


🔵 Usability

Simple UI for commuters and officials

Interactive charts and real-time feedback

📦 3. System Requirements

💻 Hardware

For model training: ≥8GB RAM, GPU (optional)

For hosting: 2 vCPUs, 4GB RAM minimum


🧰 Software

Python 3.9+

Flask / FastAPI (backend)

Streamlit / Dash / React.js (dashboard)

🧩 4. External Dependencies

Traffic API Providers (e.g., HERE Maps, OpenTraffic)

Public Datasets for training (e.g., PeMS, INRIX)

Cloud services (AWS/GCP/Render/Heroku)
