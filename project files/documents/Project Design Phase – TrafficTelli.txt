🛠 2. Module-wise Design

📥 a. Data Collection Layer

Sources: Live CCTV feeds, traffic APIs (e.g., Google Maps, TomTom), IoT devices

Format: JSON, CSV, video stream

Tools: Python + Requests/OpenCV + Kafka (if streaming)


⚙ b. Data Preprocessing Engine

Cleaning missing values, encoding timestamps, normalizing traffic data

Outlier detection and correction

Time-series windowing for prediction

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn


🧠 c. Machine Learning Prediction Engine

Model: CNN/LSTM/Hybrid model trained on historical data

Tasks: Volume estimation, congestion prediction

Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch

ML Pipeline: Train → Evaluate → Deploy (using Flask/FastAPI)


📊 d. Visualization & Dashboard

Framework: Flask + Plotly Dash / Streamlit

Features:

Real-time graph updates

Area-wise congestion levels

Historical trends


Admin panel with filters (location, time)


💾 e. Storage & Database

Raw + Processed Data: MongoDB / PostgreSQL

Model Output Logs: ElasticSearch or flat files

Cloud Storage (if applicable): S3/GCS


🔌 f. API Layer

RESTful APIs for:

Data ingestion

Model predictions

Dashboard frontend access


Frameworks: FastAPI / Flask

🔐 3. Security & Privacy Considerations

HTTPS & API authentication (e.g., JWT tokens)

Access control for user roles

Data anonymization (for video/CCTV streams)



---

🔄 4. Deployment Plan

Use of CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)

Containerization using Docker

Optional orchestration with Kubernetes for large-scale deployment

Hosting: Render, Heroku, or AWS EC2
