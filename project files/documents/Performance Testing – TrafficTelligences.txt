Performance Testing ‚Äì TrafficTelligence

üéØ Objective:

To ensure the TrafficTelligence system performs efficiently under different data loads and usage scenarios‚Äîespecially in real-time conditions.


---

üîç Key Focus Areas:

1. Response Time Testing

Measure how quickly the system responds to user queries and API requests.

Test latency in:

Real-time traffic data retrieval.

Model prediction output.

Dashboard data visualization.



Goal: Response time should remain under 2 seconds for 90% of requests.


---

2. Throughput Testing

Analyze how many predictions or dashboard requests the system can handle per second.

Simulate high-frequency API calls (e.g., 100+ requests/minute).


Goal: System should handle ‚â• 100 concurrent users with consistent performance.


---

3. Load Testing

Test the system under normal and peak loads:

Morning rush hours

Festival days or events


Simulate multiple cities/zones being monitored simultaneously.


Tools Suggested: Apache JMeter, Locust

Goal: Application should remain functional without crashes or timeouts during peak load.

4. Stress Testing

Push the system beyond its operational limits to test:

Crash behavior

Recovery time

System stability



Goal: System should gracefully degrade with proper error messages and auto-recovery mechanisms.


---

5. Scalability Testing

Test how well the system scales:

With increased data input from traffic APIs or sensors.

With increasing number of users/dashboards.



Goal: Horizontal scaling (adding more servers) should improve performance linearly or near-linearly.


---

6. Resource Utilization Testing

Monitor CPU, RAM, bandwidth, and disk usage during high-load scenarios.

Identify memory leaks or high CPU usage under prediction/model load.


Goal: Resource consumption should remain optimal and well below thresholds (e.g., <75% CPU, <70% RAM).


---

‚úÖ Expected Outcomes:

Efficient prediction and visualization under varying conditions.

Stable performance even during data surges or multi-user access.

Error-handling and failover mechanisms in place.

Infrastructure recommendations (e.g., server specs, autoscaling settings) ready for deployment.
